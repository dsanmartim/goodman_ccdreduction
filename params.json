The script will make \r\n(in order):\r\n\r\n - BIAS subtraction\r\n - TRIMMING (including slit edges identification)\r\n - FLAT correction\r\n - COSMIC rays rejection (optional)\r\n\r\nUsers can add a flag in order to clean up science data from cosmic rays, \r\nwhich are removed by using the LACosmic code (P. G. van Dokkum, 2001, \r\nPASP, 113, 1420).\r\n\r\n### Data Structure\r\n\r\nThis script was designed to make CCD reduction for any spectral \r\nconfiguration, but the input dir must contains only an unique spectral \r\nconfiguration (binning, grating, slit, gain, rdnoise, CCD ROI, etc). \r\nThe input dir should contain only the following frames:\r\n\r\n - BIAS frames\r\n - FLAT frames  \r\n - ARC frames (data from focus sequence will not be reduced)\r\n - SCIENCE and/or STANDARD frames\r\n \r\nFlats taken between science exposures will not be  consideare for master \r\nflat. They are going to be trimmed and bias subtracted).\r\n \r\nDocumentation for specific functions of the code can be found directly \r\nin the corresponding function.\r\n\r\n### How to use it...\r\n\r\nIt can be be executed in terminal running \r\n\r\n    $ python goodman_ccdreduction.py [options] raw_path red_path \r\n    \r\nMore information abotu the options and how to use it can be otained by \r\nusing...\r\n\r\n    $ python goodman_ccdreduction.py --help\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    $ python goodman_ccdreduction.py -h\r\n\r\n### ToDo (Short List)\r\n\r\n - Consider internal illumination correction (by using the flats taken \r\n without grating\r\n\r\n### Suggestions and Questions\r\n\r\nIf you have any doubt or question, please contact David Sanmartim \r\n\r\n<b>dsanmartim at ctio.noao.edud</b> (before Set 1st, 2016 ) \r\n<b>dsanmartim at gemini.edu</b> (after Set 1st, 2016)\r\n   \r\nJuly 2016\r\n\r\n",
